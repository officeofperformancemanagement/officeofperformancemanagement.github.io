<h2 id="why-the-city-of-chattanooga-">Why the City of Chattanooga?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chattanooga is one of the best cities for exploring the outdoors and nature</li>
<li>Work every day towards making Chattanooga the best place to live for all Chattanoogans</li>
<li>Meet your neighbors and build a community</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-engineering">Data Engineering</h2>
<p>Join us on our mission to make Chattanooga the best city to live in.  Your challenge as a data engineer will be to build both reliable and sustainable data pipelines, leveraging both ETL tools (like FME) and custom Python scripting.  Our vision is to make a lot of data about our city available and then catalyze the community to build an ecosystem of apps on top of this data through hackathons and community events. Having data about the city internally is also fundamental to the city’s ability to understand how things are going and where can improve service delivery. </p>
<h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2>
<p>As a Data Engineer you will be empowered to learn new technologies and try out new ideas.  If you have an idea, whenever feasible you will be given the runway to see if it can take flight.  We take security and privacy very seriously, so we will work with you to separate your open-source code from confidential data, essentially creating a sandbox to try your idea.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>We have a strong preference for solving problems in a way that categorically solves that type of problem.  Open-source is a key component of our sustainability strategy.  By building with the community, we can use the expertise of the whole community.  You can view our open-source work here: <a href="https://github.com/officeofperformancemanagement">https://github.com/officeofperformancemanagement</a></p>
<h2 id="what-we-are-looking-for">What we are looking for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with Python or SQL</li>
<li>Experience accessing APIs, including knowledge of HTTP Methods and Authentication</li>
<li>Commitment to making Chattanooga the best place to live</li>
<li>Motivation to learn skills and technologies</li>
<li>Eagerness to tackle challenging problems with no simple answers</li>
<li>Ability to collaborate across departments and the community</li>
<li>Ability to research and provide formal analyses and recommendations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-qualifications-and-responsibilities">Additional Qualifications and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Additional qualifications and responsibilities are listed at the full job description here: <a href="https://fa-eqto-saasfaprod1.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions/preview/240325">https://fa-eqto-saasfaprod1.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions/preview/240325</a> </p>
<h2 id="work-location">Work Location</h2>
<p>We recognize the benefits of remote work while also valuing in-person community building.  Finding a balance between the two, we require at least three days of work in the office per week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday).  Monday and Friday are often remote but your final schedule will depend on your specific remote work agreement.  Core working hours are 8:30am to 4:30pm.  You can also set up a flex week schedule (4 10-hour days).</p>
<h2 id="salary">Salary</h2>
<p>$56,623.00 - $68,407.00</p>
